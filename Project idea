This project, developed under the Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI), focuses on applying Manual, Automation, and API Testing using Automation Exercise as a comprehensive training platform. The website provides diverse scenarios and ready-made test cases, making it ideal for practicing real-world testing methodologies.
The technical scope includes designing and executing manual test cases, developing automation frameworks with Selenium WebDriver, TestNG/JUnit, Maven/Gradle, and setting up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions or Jenkins. For API testing, Postman, Newman, and RestAssured/PyTest will be used, while reporting will be supported through Allure or Extent Reports.
Project management will follow the Agile (Scrum) methodology with two-week sprints, clear role distribution, and the use of Jira/Trello for task management and GitHub/GitLab for version control. This approach ensures efficient collaboration, continuous integration, and delivery of high-quality testing outputs aligned with industry standards.
